# Eclipse Labs

Eclipse Labs is a community of open source projects that build technology based on 
the Eclipse platform. It provides the infrastructure services typically required by 
open source projects, such as code repositories, bug tracking, project web sites/wiki. 

Eclipse Labs projects are not official Eclipse Foundation projects. Eclipse Labs 
projects are not hosted by the Eclipse Foundation and do not have to follow the 
Eclipse Foundation development and intellectual property policies.

There are a number of things Eclipse Labs projects can not do since they are not 
official Eclipse Foundation projects, including 1) include the word Eclipse in their name, 
2) use the org.eclipse namespace for their bundles names, or 3) participate in the 
annual Eclipse release trains, unless they are included in an official Eclipse project.

Please see [Eclipse Labs FAQ](https://www.eclipse.org/org/foundation/eclipselabs/faq.php)
